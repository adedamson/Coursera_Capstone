Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture. It is considered on of the most diverse citites in the world with a large population of immigrants from around the globe. This has also made Toronto one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world. \n\nThe diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as a choice immigration destination. More than 50 percent of residents belong to a visible minority population group, and over 200 distinct ethnic origins are represented among its inhabitants. While the majority of Torontonians speak English as their primary language, over 160 languages are spoken in the city. Being a large city with a diverse population, information on hot spot / best locations would contribute greatly to the success of a new restaurant business in the city."
